# 🍽️ Recommender Model for LLM-Generated Meal Recipes

This project explores how machine learning can be used to classify meal recipes, generated by large language models (LLMs), into those users like or dislike. Beyond predictive accuracy, this project focuses on making these classifications **interpretable** using explainable AI techniques.

Initially, the project was part of an assignment for the *Business Analytics and Machine Learning* course which I took at TUM, but later I expanded it with more robust modeling, feature engineering, and explanation layers.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Classify LLM-generated recipes as liked or disliked based on user reviews and recipe metadata.
- **Core Techniques**: Binary Classification, Feature Engineering, SHAP for Explainability.
- **Key Question**: *Can we understand what makes a machine-generated recipe appealing to users?*

> Points 2-4 are in Feature_engineering_model_training.ipynb file

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
- Data structure exploration across 4 relational tables:
  - `recipes`, `reviews`, `diet`, and `requests`
- Defined preprocessing goals and feature hypotheses

### 2. **Feature Engineering & Data Preparation**: 
- Created and transformed new features
- Merged all relevant tables into a clean dataset
- Encoded categorical variables and handled missing values

### 3. **Model Training**:
- Trained multiple classification models:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
  - CatBoost
- Applied hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization

### 4. **Explainability with SHAP**:
- **Global explanations**: feature importance across all predictions
- **Local explanations**: detailed insights for individual recipe predictions
